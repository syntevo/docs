# How to examine the content of a stash

Stashes are saved modifications of the working tree. Saving a stash
allows to quickly clean-up a working tree without loosing the changes.
Later one can re-apply the saved stash to continue with the partly done
work.

To examine the saved modifications (the content of a stash), open the
log, ensure that the checkbox in front of the stash in question in the
*Branches* view is selected and scroll to the stash. You will see up to
3 commits referring to the index and working tree changes as well as to
untracked files.
