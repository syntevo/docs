# How to examine the content of a stash

Stashes are saved modifications of the working tree. Saving a stash
allows to quickly clean-up a working tree without loosing the changes.
Later one can re-apply the saved stash to continue with the partly done
work.

To examine the saved modifications (the content of a stash), in the **Log Window** ensure that the checkbox in front of the stash in the **Branches View** is selected and scroll to the stash.
You will see up to 3 commits referring to the index and working tree changes as well as to untracked files.
In the **Standard Window**, select the stash in the **Stashes View** to inspect its commits.
