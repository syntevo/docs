# How to compare two branches/commits?

Open the **Log** for your repository; there you will have two possible
ways:

-   directly in the **Graph**, select the two commits you want to
    compare (*Ctrl*-click the second commit to extend the selection);
-   in the **Branches** view, use **Reveal Commit** on the first branch
    you want to compare, then use **Compare with Selected Commit** on
    the second branch you want to compare (this will again result in the
    selection of two commits in the **Commits** graph).

Once exactly two commits are selected, the **Files** view will show the
changes from the *older* to theÂ *younger* commit. To see content changes
of an individual file, select the file and check the **Changes** view.
