# Your system ran out of virtual memory

# Introduction

When SmartGit crashed, your computer was low on virtual memory.

This usually happens due to two reasons:

1.  One of the programs on your computer is bugged, gradually eating all
    available memory.
2.  You don't have enough RAM installed and run too many programs. This
    shouldn't be the case if you have at least 16GB RAM.

# Windows: Diagnosing with Event Log

This is the best and easiest way to diagnose.

1.  Start Windows `Event Viewer` application
    1.  Go to
        `Control Panel → System and Security → Administrative Tools`
    2.  Start `Event Viewer` from there.
2.  Expand `Windows Logs → System` on the left.``
3.  Search for `Resource-Exhaustion-Detector` events  
    1.  Press Ctrl+F to open search box.
    2.  Enter `Resource-Exhaustion-Detector`
    3.  Search
4.  Investigate
    1.  Double-click found event to view details for it.

    2.  It will say something like this:



            Windows successfully diagnosed a low virtual memory condition.
            The following programs consumed the most virtual memory:
            BuggedProgram.exe (11584) consumed 55.660.101.632 bytes
            firefox.exe (5304) consumed 1.009.725.440 bytes.



    3.  Look for anything suspicious  
        Values above 4.000.000.000 bytes are already suspicious.  
        Values above 16.000.000.000 bytes most likely mean that this
        program causes problems for you.

# Windows: Diagnosing with our script

To try to diagnose the problem, please download, extract all files and
run `AnalyseMemoryUsage.cmd` :  
<https://www.syntevo.com/downloads/troubleshoot/AnalyseMemoryUsage.cmd.zip>  

Wait until it completes (usually takes some 10 seconds), scroll the output
to the top and study it.
  
These are reasonable values for typical workflows:

1.  Check `Available`. If it's only a few percent of `Total`, your system
    is probably going to run out of memory soon.
2.  If you're already low on memory, check `Usage breakdown`.
3.  If the majority of memory is spent on running programs, continue to
    `Programs breakdown` section.
4.  If the majority of memory falls into `Not explained` category, check
    if you're running virtual machines (VMWare, VirtualBox, Docker, WSL,
    etc). Otherwise, a screenshot of RAMMap (see below) will be needed to
    continue investigation.
5.  If unsure, please send script output to us and we'll try to help.

# Windows: Diagnosing with RAMMap

[SysInternals RAMMap](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rammap)
is an utility that shows some additional kernel memory stats.

In typical workflows, each of these values should be below 1GB:

1.  Page Table
2.  Paged Pool
3.  Nonpaged pool
4.  System PTE (except when you run virtual machines)
5.  Session private
6.  Driver Locked
7.  Kernel Stack

If any of these counters is significantly higher then 1GB, this likely
points to a problem. Diagnosing it further is different for every case.
