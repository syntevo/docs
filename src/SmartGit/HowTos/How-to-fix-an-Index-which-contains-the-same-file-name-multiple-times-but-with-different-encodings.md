# How to fix an Index which contains the same file name multiple times, but with different encodings

## Background

The *Index* file (`.git/index`) contains meta-information related to the
working tree and is constrained by Git to have exactly one entry per
file (and stage level). While Git handles file names as raw
*byte-sequences*, SmartGit interprets them as *(Unicode-)Strings* to
display them more nicely. Certain parts of a byte sequence may not
represent a valid encoding, hence the relevant parts of the byte
sequence will be replaced by the 'Unicode replacement character ' (ï¿½,
U+FFFD). If the *Index* contains two byte sequences which differ only in
'unconvertible' parts, the resulting *Strings* may be identical. Such
*Index* entries are confusing (not only SmartGit) and need to be fixed.


> [!NOTE]
> This kind of problem might occur after updating to *msysgit 1.7.10* and not properly converting non-unicode file names.

## Resolution

If an encoding problem in the *Index* is encountered, SmartGit will show
an error message which contains information about the problematic file.
The resolution is performed using Git from the command line:

-   `cd` to your repository.
-   Invoke `git status` to be sure you have a clean working tree and
    Index. If not clean, either commit or stash away your local
    modifications.
-   For msysgit, on Windows: invoke `bash.exe` to enter Git's shell.
-   Invoke `git ls-files | grep <readable-part-of-the-file-name>`.
-   Inspect the output of the command and identify the offending
    entries: usually they will be almost identical, but only differ at
    certain positions where the *octal* encoding (\\xyz) slightly
    varies. In the next step we will remove these offending entries from
    the repository (and re-add them again, if necessary). Hence, for
    every offending entry *\<path-to-file>*:
-   Make a backup of *\<path-to-file>* and
-   Invoke `` git rm --cached "`printf "<path-to-file>"`" `` (Note: all
    the quotes are necessary!).


> [!NOTE]
> On Windows, you may also work without `bash.exe`: just open a *command line (DOS box)* and invoke `git rm --cached <path-to-file-pattern>` with `<path-to-file-pattern>` being an unambiguous pattern of the file's path where the non-ASCII characters are replaced by `?`. E.g.: `x?y.txt`.

-   After all entries have been removed, invoke
    `git commit -m "clean up bad encoding of file names"`.
-   If necessary, re-add the entries (this time with correct encoding)
    with `git add .` and finally commit with
    `git commit --amend -m "clean up bad encoding of file names"`.
-   Now SmartGit should be able to open the repository. Don't forget to
    push your changes!
