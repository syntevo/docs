# Configure Dictionaries

To get spell-check for your preferred language in commit messages, you can use OpenOffice/LibreOffice dictionary files.

### Example

Download the **French** dictionary from [this link](https://extensions.openoffice.org/en/project/french-dictionaries).
Rename the downloaded `.oxt` file to `.zip` and unpack that file.
In the `directories` directory you can find some `.dic` (and `.aff`) files.
In SmartGit's preferences, page **Spell Checker**, click **Add** and select the appropriate `.dic` file.

Now you can select in the context menu of the commit message input field which spell checker to use.
