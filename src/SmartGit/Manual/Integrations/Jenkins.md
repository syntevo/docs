# Jenkins integration (Standard Window only)

SmartGit will display Jenkins job results in the **My History** view of *Standard* window, if configured. Currently, *free style projects* and *multibranch pipelines* are supported.

## Configuration

The integration is configured in the repository's `.git/config`, using `smartgit.jenkins.`-keys:

* `url`: the root URL of your Jenkins server

At least one project type must be configured:

* `freeStyleProjects`: a comma-separated list of free style project names which should be queried
* `multiBranchPipelines`: a comma-separated list of multibranch pipeline project names which should be queried

#### Example

>
>``` ini
>[smartgit "jenkins"]
>   url = http://localhost:8080
>   freeStyleProjects = tests,tests-gitimpl,tests-jgit
>```
