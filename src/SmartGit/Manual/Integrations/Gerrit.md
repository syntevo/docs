# Gerrit

SmartGit provides integration with Gerrit in the **Log** and the **Working Tree** windows.
You can invoke the **Push to Gerrit** command in the **Branches** view if a Gerrit remote has been detected.
It will offer a dialog with special Gerrit-related Push options.

Prerequisites are that `.git/hooks/commit-msg` exists and is related to Gerrit.

## .gitreview

If a `.gitreview` file is present in the root directory of your repository, SmartGit will detect the Gerrit server from its properties, according to the [git-review documentation](https://linux.die.net/man/1/git-review).
Given this configuration, a matching remote will be looked up from your `.git/config`.

The `defaultbranch` will be used as **Target** branch if configured.

If there is a `review.remote` configuration present in your `.git/config`, this will take precedence.

## General remote detection

If there is no `.gitreview` file present, SmartGit will detect a remote as being connected to Gerrit if an appropriate `remote` can be determined from `.gitconfig` for the selected branch:

- If the remote is configured as `review.remote`, this remote will be used.
- If the branch is tracking a remote branch and its remote is connecting to port 29418 (default Gerrit SSH port), this remote will be used.
- If the branch is not tracking a remote branch:
    - If there is a unique remote connecting to port 29418, this remote is used.
    - If there is no remote connecting to port 29418 but there is only a single remote overall, this remote is used.

> [!TIP]
> To have Gerrit-related commands available in context menu, set [Low-level Property](../GUI/AdvancedSettings/System-Properties.md) `ui.showPushToGerritInMenu`.

> [!NOTE]
> If **Push to Gerrit** doesn't show up for you despite of the above conditions being met, you may enable debug logging for "smartgit.gerrit".
> For details refer to Debugging.
