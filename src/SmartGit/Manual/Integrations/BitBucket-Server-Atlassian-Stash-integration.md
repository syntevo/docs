# BitBucket Server (Atlassian Stash) integration

SmartGit integrates BitBucket Server (Atlassian Stash) workflows in several places, very similar to the [GitHub](GitHub-integration.md) integration.

### Setup

To set up the BitBucket Serve integration, first you have to create a *personal access token* in Bitbucket Server: go to **Manage Account**, select **Personal access tokens** and **Create a token**. For the **Token name**, use something like "SmartGit" here and for **Permissions**, select **Write** access.

After invoking **Create**, copy the token to the clipboard and also consider to store it in some safe place (like a password manager), because you won't be able to access this token again from the Bitbucket UI.

In SmartGit, go to **Preferences**, section **Hosting Providers** and use **Add** there. In the **Add Hosting Provider** dialog, have **Bitbucket Server** selected:

- for **Account** use your Bitbucket Server account name
- for **Password** use the generated access token
- for **Server URL** enter the same top-level **URL** which you are using in your browser to access Bitbucket

#### Note

>
>Unless your server is using 2-way-SSL, you don't need to provide **Client Certificate** and **Client Password**.
> Authentication using *SSH* is unrelated to this configuration.
