# GitHub Actions integration (only Standard window)

SmartGit will display GitHub Actions workflow run results in the **My History** view of the
[*Standard Window*](../GUI/Standard-Window.md), if the [GitHub integration](GitHub-integration.md) is correctly configured.

## Additional Configuration

By default, SmartGit will query for all GitHub Actions workflows. To limit the list of workflows, you can use `smartgit.github-actions.`-keys in your repository's `.git/config`:

* `workflows`: a comma-separated list of GitHub Actions workflow names which should be queried

#### Example

>
>``` text
>[smartgit "github-actions"]
>   workflows = ci
>```
