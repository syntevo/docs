# Integrated Comments
Once integrated with a Hosting Provider, SmartGit allows comments on commits and Pull Requests in the repository to be retrieved from the Hosting Provider.

Depending on the Hosting Service, comments can either be added to a commit, or to individual line changes on diffs in the commit.

**TODO** - Comments can be applied to a commit or to a Pull Request.

Pull Request Comments will be refreshed together with those pull requests which are locally available (see Fetch Pull Request above).
Plain Commit Comments will by default not be refreshed for performance reasons. To tell SmartGit to fetch plain commit comments, too, configure github.commitCommentPageLimit in the Preferences, Low-Level Properties.

Both, Pull Request and Plain Commit Comments, can refer either to a commit itself or to a specific line in a file:

Commit comments will show up in the Commits view.
Comments on individual lines will show up in the Changes view and the affected files will be highlighted in the Files and Commits view, too. This works the same way for line-comments of Pull Requests, provided that the pull request has been Fetched and the local pull request merge commit has been selected.
Comments can be created, modified and removed using the corresponding actions from the Comments menu or context menu actions in the Commits and Changes view. If a pull request merge commit is selected, only line-comments of the pull request can be manipulated.

More behavior of the GitHub integration can be customized by Low-Level Properties.


After commenting changes, itâ€™s probably a good idea to Reject the pull request to signal the initiator of the pull request, that modifications are required before you are willing to pull his changes. If you are fine with a pull request, you may Merge it. This will request the GitHub server to merge the pull request and then SmartGit will pull the corresponding branch, so you will have the merged changes locally available.
