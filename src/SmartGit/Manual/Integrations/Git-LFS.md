# Git-LFS

SmartGit provides support for common Git Large File Storage (Git-LFS) operations, provided that Git-LFS has been installed on your system and it's configured in your Git config files, so that Git-LFS is already configured and tested to be working from the command line.

## Implementing low-level commands

SmartGit implements low-level Git-LFS commands and provides them in the **Local\|LFS** menu. There is almost a 1-1 correspondence between SmartGit commands and Git-LFS command line.

#### Example: setting up and adding files to Git-LFS

> We are following the [Git-LFS tutorial](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial) to add a file to Git-LFS:
>
> - `git lfs install`: invoke **Local\|LFS\|Install**
> - `git lfs track <file>`: select an *untracked* file in SmartGit's **Files** view and invoke **Local\|LFS\|Track**;
    > SmartGit suggests a matching pattern for the selected file which you can adjust if necessary
> - `git add .gitattributes`: right click `.gitattributes` and invoke **Add**
> - `git add <file>`: right click the file and invoke **Add**
> - `git commit`: invoke **Commit**

#### Note

> If you are encountering unexpected errors when invoking **Lock** or **Unlock** on Window, this may be caused by a strange behavior of current Git-LFS versions (2.5) which will fail when invoked with a working directory with wrong case.
> To workaround the problem, make sure that the path in `repositories.xml` has correct case, especially the drive letter must be uppercase, for example:
>
> ``` java
> <obj type="@Repository" id="...">
>     <prop key="name" type="String" value="smartgit"/>
>     <prop key="favorite" type="boolean" value="true"/>
>     <prop key="git" type="boolean" value="true"/>
>     <prop key="path" type="String" value="D:\\smartgit"/>
>     <prop key="expanded" type="boolean" value="false"/>
> </obj>
> ```

## Displaying locks

To see Git-LFS lock states in the **Files** views (both Log and Working tree window), Git-LFS locks verification must be enabled for your repositories. A corresponding `.git/config` might look like:

```
[lfs "https://server/repo.git/info/lfs"]
    ...
    locksVerify = true
```

Furthermore, you have to enable property `status.lfs.locks` in the **Preferences**, section **Low-level Properties**. This will make SmartGit invoke additional commands:

- `git lfs locks --local`
- `git lfs locks --remote`

after every **Pull**, **Fetch** and after every background **Fetch** (if enabled in the **Preferences**, section **Background Commands**).

The output of these `git lfs locks` commands will be written to:

- `./git/smartgit/lfs-locks-local`
- `./git/smartgit/lfs-locks-remote`

Once these files are present, the **Name** column icon will start denoting the locking state for LFS files.

#### Example

The following screenshot shows how this display will look like:

- `file` is normal file to which no LFS lock information applies
- `huge` is *locked by someone else*
- `huge2` is *locked by yourself*
- `huge3` is *lockable* (configured in` .gitattributes`)

#### Note

> In the **Log** window, lock states will only be displayed for the **Working Tree** node.

## Fix possible problems

If your `git-lfs` executable is not found by SmartGit, try to use absolute paths for the `git-lfs` executable configuration in the `gitconfig` file containing the Git-LFS filter definition.
