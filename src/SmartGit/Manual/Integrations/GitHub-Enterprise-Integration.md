# GitHub Enterprise Integration

Authenticating to a GitHub Enterprise instance is slightly different than to *github.com* due to the nature of *OAuth*. Basically you have to use **Personal Access Tokens** there. This approach can be performed by an individual user without needing administrative rights for the GitHub Enterprise instance.

# Personal Access Token

Personal access tokens are working for GitHub Enterprise as well as for *github.com*. To create a personal access token, go to your **Account** settings and select **Personal Access Tokens**. Invoke **Generate New Token**, enter `SmartGit` for the **Token Description** and for **Select scopes** select the `repo` scope and the `read:org` scope.

After confirming with **Generate Token**, you will see the new token in your list of tokens. Copy the token to the clipboard and paste it into the **Token** field of SmartGit's **GitHub** configuration dialog.
