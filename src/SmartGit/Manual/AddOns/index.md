# Add-Ons to SmartGit

SmartGit provides the following optional Add-Ons which can be used to enhance your SmartGit installation:

- [Distributed Reviews Add-On](Distributed-Reviews-add-on-.md), allowing your team to comment and contribute feedback on *Distributed Reviews Pull Requests*.
- [Server Side Component](Server-side-component.md), which is built on top of the Distributed Reviews functionality and which can be used to notify team members when certain Pull Request related events occur.

Both of the above Add-Ons are useful in organizations where your Git remote repository hosting service does not provide an interactive Pull Request mechanism for your team.
If you are using GitHub, Azure DevOps, or other Git hosting services which provide interactive review facilities, we suggest you use the hosting provider review mechanism instead.
