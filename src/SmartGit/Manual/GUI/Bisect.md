# Bisect

The Bisect command allows you to find out which previous commit introduced problematic behavior in your project's repository, e.g., to find the origin of a bug which was not present in a previous release of an application.

Bisect works interatively, by checking out a commit approximately mid-way between the current commit (with the bug), and an earlier commit which was known **not** to have contained the bug.

You'll then be required to tell git whether this 'mid point' commit contains the bug (by marking the commit as *bad*), or worked correctly (marking the commit as *good*), e.g. by compiling this version of the application and performing a test. 
Depending on your response, git will bisect the remaining commits between this midpoint and either the starting commit (if you replied *bad*), or to the current commit (if the midpoint was *good*).

The process repeats until you narrow down the exact commit which introduced the bug.

In this manner, git bisect will efficiently be able to locate the problematic commit by performing a binary search - given N possible commits, you will be able to locate the bug in at most **log <sub>2</sub> N + 1** steps.

## Bisecting using SmartGit

It is recommended that you use bisect in the SmartGit Log or Standard Windows. The Working Tree Window has limited bisect related functionality.

Start a Bisect command by using the menu item **Branch \| Bisect \| Start**. 
Typically, the current branch HEAD contains the *bad* behavior, so you will usually select **Start Bisect with Bad HEAD**. 
The HEAD commit show as a red dot, which means *bad*. 
*Good* commits will be shown as green dots.

Now you will have to find a *good* commit in the commit history that did not contain the issue.

If you are confident that a prior commit (e.g. the inital commit) did not contain the issue, then you can right click on that commit and select `Mark as Good`. 
If you are unsure, you will need to checkout an earlier commit.

Now test your application to see whether the issue was present in this commit.

Then, select the corresponding buttons **Mark HEAD as Bad** or **Mark HEAD as Good**.

If your application still shows *bad* behavior at this commit, you need to repeat the checkout step and an even earlier commit, until you find a commit which does not contain the issue.

Once you have marked both a *bad* and a *good* commit, the bisecting process starts.

SmartGit will now automatically check out a commit midway between the closest *bad* and *good* commits.

Verify whether your application behaves correctly at this commit, and use the buttons **Mark HEAD as Bad** or **Mark HEAD as Good** as appropriate.

Iterate the above to quickly find the problematic commit that causes the trouble (git bisect will automatically checkout the commits, based on a binary search). 
Once there are no remaining commits to be tested between a *good* and *bad* commit, SmartGit will show a dialog identifying the commit and author when the issue was introduced into the repository. 
You can choose to exit by selecting *Leave Bisect*, or you can abort the bisect by clicking **Abort** (in the banner).

Completing or Aborting will check out the branch which was checked out when the Bisect command was first started.
