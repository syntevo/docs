# Working with Branches in SmartGit

Branches are an essential part of Git, allowing you to conceptually track and manage changes to your repository.
SmartGit's UI exposes all common branch actions intuitively through views on the user interface.

## Contents

Please choose from one of the following topics:

- Using [Check Out](Check-Out.md) to checkout and switch between branches.
- [Merging branches](Merge.md).
- [Rebasing](Rebase.md) and [Interactive Rebase](Rebase-Interactive.md).
- [Cherry Picking](Cherry-Pick.md) commits into a branch.
- [Reverting](Revert.md) unwanted commits by creating a new commit.
- [Manipulating Branches and Tags](Manipulating-branches-tags.md).
- [Using the SmartGit Conflict Resolver](Conflict-Solver.md) to resolve conflicts.
