## Opening a Repository

Use **Repository \| Add or Create** to either open an existing local repository (e.g., initialized or cloned with the Git command line client) or to initialize a new repository.

Specify the local directory you want to open. If the specified directory is not yet a Git repository, you can initialize it.

## Settings

Once you have opened a repository, use [**Repository \| Settings**](Repository-Settings.md) to configure repository-specific settings.

## The Garbage Collector

The Git Garbage Collector performs housekeeping tasks such as deleting commits which are no longer referenced in the repository, such as:

- commits which have been rebased
- commits which have been amended and rewritten to a new commit
- commits which have been squashed

The Git Garbage Collector usually runs in the background, however, you can choose to explicitly execute the **Run Garbage Collector** command to force the garbage collector (`git gc`) to run immediately.

You can view commits eligible for garbage collection in SmartGit's Log by selecting the **Recyclable Commits** option in the **Branches** view of the [Log Window](../Log-Window.md).
