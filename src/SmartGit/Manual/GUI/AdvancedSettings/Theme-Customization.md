# Customizing SmartGit's Theme Colors

You can customize certain colors in SmartGit by patching its themes.
The custom colors are configured in files `light-patch.theme` and `dark-patch.theme` in [SmartGit's Settings Directory](../../Installation/Installation-and-Files.md#default-path-of-smartgits-settings-directory).
Depending on the selected theme from the **Preferences**, the appropriate file will be used.
In case of automatic theme selection (which is the default), your system theme (light or dark) will determine the used file.

> [!NOTE]
> These files only will be read on SmartGit start.

## List of Customizable Colors

To get a complete list of customizable colors, you can run SmartGit from command line using parameter `--write-default-theme-file`.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> On Windows, you have to run `smartgitc.exe`:
> ```
> smartgitc.exe --write-default-theme-file
> ```

This will create `own-dark.theme` and `own-light.theme` files in SmartGit's settings directory which will contain all keys and their defaults.
You can now copy over selected keys to your `patch`-files; be sure to drop the leading comment mark `#`.

### Sample Colors

The following is an incomplete list of important theme colors which can be customized.
