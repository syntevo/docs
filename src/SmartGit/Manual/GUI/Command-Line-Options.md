# Command-Line Options

This section gives an overview of the various command-line options which can be passed as parameters to the SmartGit launcher at start-up. The launcher used by SmartGit depends on your platform:

- **Windows** `bin\smartgit.exe` or `bin\smartgitc.exe`.
  `smartgit.exe` is meant for regular usage, while `smartgitc.exe` will print additional information on the console while the program runs.
- **MacOS** `SmartGit <version-number>.app/Contents/MacOS/SmartGit`
- **Linux** `bin/smartgit.sh`

In the following, we'll use `smartgitc.exe` as an example to explain the available options. Substitute it with the respective launcher for your platform if you're not using Windows.

There may be additional options available that mainly serve debugging purposes and are therefore not documented here.

## Options "-?" and "--help"

With either of the two following commands you can print all command-line options on the console that are specifically supported by the version of SmartGit you're using:

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe -?`
>
>`smartgitc.exe --help`

#### Note

> On Windows, make sure to call `smartgitc.exe` (with 'c' on the end), otherwise when calling `smartgit.exe` this parameter has no effect, since the SmartGit process won't be attached to any console to print the help output to.

## Option "--open"

This option launches SmartGit and opens the repository in the specified location. It's the default option and may be omitted.

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --open C:\path\to\repository`

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --cwd C:\path --open to\repository`

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe .`

## Option "--cwd"

This option sets the current working directory, which affects the path given in the `open`, `log` and `blame` option (see below) as follows:

- If the `open`, `log` or `blame` options are specified without their own path arguments, the path given with the `cwd` option will be used as argument for `open` or `log`.
- If the `open`, `log` or `blame` options are specified with relative paths, these relative paths will be resolved against the path given with the `cwd` option.
- If the `open`, `log` or `blame` options are specified with absolute paths, the path given with the `cwd` option is ignored.

The path given with the `cwd` option must be an absolute path. If the path is relative, it will be ignored.

## Option "--log"

This option opens SmartGit's Log window for the repository or file in the specified location.

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --log C:\path\to\repository\path\to\file`

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --cwd C:\path --log to\repository`

## Option "--blame"

This option opens SmartGit's Blame window for the specified file.

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --blame C:\path\to\repository\path\to\file`

When adding a colon with the line number at the file end, it will scroll to the specified line.

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --blame C:\path\to\repository\path\to\file:400`

## Option "--investigate"

This option opens the built-in DeepGit for the specified file. When adding a colon with the line number at the file end, it will scroll to the specified line.

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --investigate C:\path\to\repository\path\to\file:400`

## Option "--anchor-commit"

This option can be optionally specified in addition to "--log", "--blame" and "--investigate" and defines the *anchor commit* of the Log. The anchor commit will be made visible and preselected in the **Commits** view.

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --log C:\path\to\repository\path\to\file --anchor-commit=10de7ee0313e79c406d729f4c3e11f286df54f05`

## Option "--write-default-theme-file"

Use this option to create the file `own.theme` in the SmartGit [settings directory](AdvancedSettings/VM-options.md) (the exact file path is displayed) as starting base for creating a SmartGit theme. You can rename or move the file.

The file contains *key=value* lines, a leading \# comments out the line. The most keys should be self-explaining. The value usually is a color defined as `#rrggbb` using hexadecimal values, but it also can be name of another key which makes it easier to create a couple of named colors instead of having to write the same `#rrggbb` value for different controls.
*inherit* means to inherit the color from the parent control, *default* forces the control to use its default color from the operating system. You can SmartGit tell to load this file by selecting it in the preferences:

#### Example

> To create a theme that uses a green background color for selection, uncomment the line
>
>`#selection.background=#5968B2`
>
>by removing the leading \# and change the value to a green value:
>
>`selection.background=#3DAF3F`
>
>and restart SmartGit.

## Option "--add-tool"

Use this option to add a new *diff tool* or *conflict solver* (see **Preferences**, **Diff Tools** and **Conflict Solvers**). To add a *diff tool*, invoke:

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --add-tool type=diff pattern=*.eap "command=<local-path-to-your-diff-tool>" "parameters=${leftFile} ${rightFile}"`

To add a *conflict solver*, invoke:

#### Example

> `smartgitc.exe --add-tool type=merge pattern=*.eap "command=<local-path-to-your-conflict-solver>`" "parameters=${leftFile} ${rightFile} ${baseFile} ${mergedFile}"
