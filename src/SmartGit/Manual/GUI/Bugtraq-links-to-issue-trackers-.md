# Bugtraq (links to issue trackers)

Git Bugtraq is a [de-facto standard](https://github.com/mstrap/bugtraq) configuration file added into your Git Repository, enabling integration between tools such as SmartGit and common Bug Tracking tools such as JIRA or GitHub issues.

If you have set up a *Bugtraq Configuration*, SmartGit will detect issue IDs in commit messages and display links to the issue tracker in this case. The Bugtraq configuration is stored either in the `.gitbugtraq` file in your repository root (for all users of the repository) or in your repositories' `.git/config` (just for you). It consists of a named `bugtraq` section which basically defines a regular expression to match issue IDs in your commit message and an URL template to open when clicking at such an issue link.

#### Example

>
>
>
>An example configuration for the *JIRA* issue tracker at URL
> `https://host/jira` for a project called 'SG' looks like the following.
>
>
>
>``` text
>[bugtraq "jira"]
> url = https://host/jira/browse/SG-%BUGID%
> logRegex = SG-(\\d+)                   
>```
>
>
>
>The above example will make only the issue numbers as links (i.e.
> without `SG-`). Alternatively, if you want to have the entire issue ID
> as link (i.e. with `SG-`), you may use:
>
>
>
>``` text
>[bugtraq "jira"]
> url = https://host/jira/browse/%BUGID%
> loglinkregex = SG-\\d+
> logregex = \\d+            
>```
>
>
>
>For multiple *JIRA* projects, a configuration could look like:
>
>
>
>``` text
>[bugtraq "jira"]
> projects = SG
> url = https://host/jira/browse/%PROJECT%-%BUGID%
> loglinkregex = %PROJECT%-\\d+
> logregex = \\d+            
>```
>
>
>
>Another example configuration (e.g. for a trouble ticketing system)
> where IDs like '#213' should be matched only at the beginning of a
> commit message. Note that the logregex needs to be put in quotes,
> because '#' serves as a comment character in Git configuration files.
>
>
>
>``` text
>[bugtraq "otrs"]
> url = "https://otrs/index.pl?Action=AgentTicketZoom;TicketID=%BUGID%"
> logregex = "^#[0-9]{1,5}"            
>```
>
>

The `logRegex` must contain only one matching group '()' matching the issue ID. You can use additional non-matching groups '(?:)' for other parts of your regex (or '(?i)' for case insensitive matching). For more details refer to the complete specification at
