# On-premise update server

If you have a large number of SmartGit installations on your corporate network, it may be convenient to replicate our way of deployment in your company.

Advantages of an on-premise SmartGit Update Server:

- Light-weight updates are managed by SmartGit itself:
    - they usually don't require admin privileges
    - they occur in the background, and won't disturb the user
- Less effort in deploying new versions, once the infrastructure is set up.
- Internet bandwidth savings, as patches are downloaded once and cached on the update server before distribution to SmartGit end users on the network.
- Ensuring all developers on the network use the same version of SmartGit, easing internal support operations and increasing uniformity across the team.
- Avoiding the need to configure proxies or to whitelist Syntevo distribution endpoints on individual developer machines.

Disadvantages of an on-premise SmartGit Update Server:

- Initial effort required to set up the infrastructure
- Some updates (usually the first build of a major version) requires admin privileges for SmartGit's updater to run
- Occasionally, there may be updates (usually a new major version) which can't be run by SmartGit's updater. In this case, a fresh installation may be necessary. SmartGit provides notification mechanisms to inform your users about such updates (the same way as we would do with our users).

# Central updates repository

To provide the updates to your users, a central "repository" has to be set up (the term "repository" is completely unrelated to a Git repository). The repository must be accessible either over HTTP- or file-protocol and must provide endpoints for:

- An "autoupdate" file
- Several control files and all files which make up the installation
- A human-readable HTML information page

Let's assume that the custom update server's URL is `http://updateserver/smartgit` (`updateserver` may contain a port, too)
which offers the following endpoints:

- `http://updateserver/smartgit/autoupdate`
- `http://updateserver/smartgit/updates`
- `http://updateserver/smartgit/info`

#### Info

> If you want to use `file://`-protocol instead of `http://`-protocol, for
> example, the URL for local file `d:\update-server\autoupdate` would be
> `file://localhost/d:/update-server/autoupdate`. The URL for a network
> share file `\\update-server\autoupdate` would
> be `file://update-server/autoupdate`.

## Autoupdate file

The `autoupdate` file is the entry-point for the entire update procedure. It will be read by SmartGit on every invocation of the check for new versions. For a reference `autoupdate` file, refer to our main `autoupdate`-file at <http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/autoupdate>.

The `autoupdate` file contains directions for each major version of SmartGit and its top-level structure looks like:

``` xml
<updateinfo>
    <product id="syntevo.smartgit.release-X">
        ...
    </product>
    <product id="syntevo.smartgit.release-Y">
        ...
    </product>
    ...
<updateinfo> 
```

A `<product>`-element will usually contain a `<version>`-element which gives details on the update target version and has basically following structure:

``` xml
<version>
    <major-version>...</major-version>
    <major-date>...</major-date>
    <build>...</build>
    <name>...</name>
    <date>...</date>
    <location>...</location>
    <update-url>...</update-url>
     ...
</version>
```

You will usually want to copy these elements over from our main `autoupdate`-file and only adjust the `<location>`-element and the
`<update-url>`-element to your company-internal URLs. An example `<version>`-element for SmartGit 17.1.2 **with adjusted paths** might look like:

#### Example

> ``` xml
> <version>  
>     <major-version>17.1</major-version>  
>     <major-date>2017-10-12</major-date>  
>     <build>11190</build>  
>     <name>17.1.2</name>  
>     <date>2017-11-14</date>  
>     <location>http://updateserver/smartgit/info</location>         
>     <update-url>http://updateserver/smartgit/updates/control-11190</update-url>  
>     <update-delay>3600</update-delay>  
>     <update-density>100</update-density>  
>     <update-density-max>100</update-density-max>  
> </version>
> ```

The important URL is `<update-url>` which specifies the URL-**prefix** for the update "control"-files. The `<location>`-URL is of minor importance and will just be displayed by SmartGit if an automatic upgrade is not possible (which should almost never be the case).

Depending on the operating system, the URL-prefix will be completed to a full URL by appending:

- `-win` for Windows
- `-gen` for Linux
- `-macos-aarch64` or `-macos-x86_64` for MacOS

#### Example

> The complete URL for the Windows update control file will look like:
>
>    http://updateserver/smartgit/updates/control-11190-win
>
>

## Control file

The "control" file specifies how the final SmartGit installation must look like after an update. The basic structure of a control file looks like:

``` text
HEADER
build=...
minRequiredBuild=...
sourceRootUrl=...
...
CONTENT
...
<signature>
```

You will usually want to copy the control files from our website as-is and only adjust the `sourceRoolUrl` to your company-internal URL. An example Windows update control file for SmartGit 17.1.2 **with adjusted URL** might look like:

#### Example

>
>
>
>`HEADERbuild=11190minRequiredBuild=11170versionName=17.1.2majorName=17.1majorDate=2017-10-12executable32bit=bin/smartgit.exeexecutable64bit=bin/smartgit64.exe         sourceRootUrl=http://updateserver/smartgit/updates         copyPatterns=bin/*.vmoptions,.settings/*,.updates/*,unins???.dat,unins???.exeskipPatterns=lib/hgext/*.pycCONTENTe6971f3e69c064e0468f13ae02a332b913f8e659    f    changelog.txt    changelog.txt...`
>
>

The `CONTENT` section describes exactly how the installation should look like and consists one line for very file which will be present in the installation:

``` text
<sha> <type> <name-on-server> <relative-path-in-installation>
```

URLs for all files mentioned in the `CONTENT` section will be composed by concatenating the `sourceUrl + / + <name-on-server> + . + <sha>.`

#### Example

>
>
>
>The complete URL for `changelog.txt` from the above example will be:
>
>http://updateserver/smartgit/updates/changelog.txt.e6971f3e69c064e0468f13ae02a332b913f8e659

### Details on control file HEADER fields

- `build` specifies the SmartGit build number. It must match the `autoupdate`'s `<build>`-element and the hard-coded build number in the SmartGit binaries. Hence, do **never change** this field.
- `minRequiredBuild` specifies the minimum build number which the local installation must be of for a *light-weight* update (see
  [Installation and Files](Installation-and-Files.md)). If the local build number is lower, an *installation update* will occur. Usually you will simply copy over `control` files as we have published them and only adjust the `sourceRootUrl`. In case you want to change the installation directory (see below) as part of the update, you have to set `minRequiredBuild` to the same value as `build`.
- `versionName` and `majorVersionName` will only be used in the UI and should not be changed.
- `majorDate` will be used to decide whether an upgrade to a new major version is supported by the license and should not be changed.
- `executable32bit` and `executable64bit` specifies the binaries which will be launched after an *installation update*. Usually they should not be changed.
- `sourceRootUrl` has been discussed already and must **always be adjusted**.
- `copyPatterns` will be applied to all files in the old installation which were not known to be part of the old installation ("unknown files"), i.e. such files are not listed in the `control`-file of the old installation. Those unknown files which are matched by the pattern will be copied over to the new installation. For example, `bin/smartgit.vmoptions` is not part of the installation and hence will be copied over from old to new installation.
- `skipPatterns` will also be applied to unknown files and directs SmartGit to ignore them when cleaning up the old installation. With regards to the cleanup, an unknown file may have been copied to the new installation, may have been skipped or may have not been handled in which case it will remain in the old installation. If the old installation is not empty after the cleanup, the SmartGit updater will warn about this fact and an `-archive` directory with the unhandled files will remain on disk.

## Populating the updates "repository"

`autoupdate` and `control`-files can easily be fetched from our website. To fetch all files listed in the `control` file, you have two options:

- write a script which will fetch all these files from our website and put it onto your update server
- have a temporary SmartGit installation, let it fetch all necessary files using `Help \| Check for New Version` and copy files over from SmartGit's local update "repository" (see [Installation and Files](Installation-and-Files.md)) to your update server.

# Required and helpful SmartGit system properties

#### Note

> The following system properties should be added to
> `bin/smartgit.vmoptions`, so they will be part of the installation and
> automatically present for every user.

#### smartgit.updateCheckUrl (required)

The URL of the `autoupdate` file which SmartGit will access can be configured by system property `smartgit.updateCheckUrl`.

#### Example

>
>
>
>`-Dsmartgit.updateCheckUrl=http://updateserver/smartgit/autoupdate       `
>
>

#### smartgit.autoupdate.checkSignature (required)

Every `control` file ends with a `<signature>` which secures this file against tampering. By default, SmartGit will reject `control` files for which the signature does not match. To make SmartGit accept such `control` files, you have to set system property `smartgit.autoupdate.checkSignature=false.` **Be careful!** By switching off this important check, everyone who gains control over the update server can deploy arbitrarily modified and possibly harmful SmartGit binaries.

#### smartgit.updateCheck.force smartgit.updateCheck.intervalSecs (optional)

By default, the update check will be performed on every SmartGit startup
(if at least 23 hours have passed since the last check) and from then on all 23 hours. You may optionally shorten this interval by adding system property `smartgit.updateCheck.force=true` and specifying the desired interval in seconds using `smartgit.updateCheck.intervalSecs`.

# Customizing the installation

When replicating the `control`-files as they are and only adjusting the `sourceRootUrl`, SmartGit updates from your company server will look exactly the same as when done from our main server. But as we have seen above, to use a custom update-server, `smartgit.vmoptions` has to be adjusted and these changes must be preserved after an update. By default, SmartGit will copy "unknown" files from the old installation over to the new installation, so the file will be preserved automatically. However, it's better to not rely on this mechanism and instead make these system properties part of your custom installation. This way you will be able to add additional system properties on demand. In a similar way you may add, replace or remove additional files on demand, like the `default/license` file.

# Debugging SmartGit's update mechanism

If updates are not working as expected, it can be helpful to debug the update mechanism by adding following system property **temporarily**
to `smartgit.properties` of your test installation:

``` properties
logging.q.application.update=DEBUG
```

After restarting SmartGit, you may grep `log.txt.0`
for `q.application.update`.
