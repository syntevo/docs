## Single Computer Installation

When you launch the SmartGit installer, depending on your operating system, you will need to provide the following information:
- The directory location where SmartGit should be installed.
- Where the SmartGit application will be launched from on your operating system's UI, for instance on Microsoft Windows, by providing the Start Menu folder name for SmartGit, and whether a SmartGit Icon should be placed on your desktop.
- Whether to install SmartGit as a context menu, for instance, on Windows, right-clicking on a folder will allow you choose `Open in SmartGit` to launch SmartGit at this folder location.

#### Note
> Depending on your operating system, you will need up to 500MB of available disk space for a full installation.

SmartGit will then prompt for confirmation to proceed with the installation.
Installation may take several minutes to complete.

After installation, you will have the option to launch SmartGit for the first time, where you will be able to customize SmartGit, including your preferred selection of [Main Window](../GUI/Main-Windows.md).
