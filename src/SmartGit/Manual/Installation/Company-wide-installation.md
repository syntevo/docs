# Company-wide installation

For company-wide installations, the administrator may install SmartGit on a read-only location or network share or customize the installation process by e.g. using batch files. To set up a custom initial configuration for the users, certain settings files can be prepared and put into a directory named `default`. For MacOS this `default` directory must be located in `SmartGit.app/Contents/Resources/` (parallel to the `Java` directory). For other operating systems, the `default` directory must be located within SmartGit's installation directory, and parallel to the `lib` and `bin` directories.

#### Example

> On a Linux system where the SmartGit installation directory is
>
>```
>/opt/smartgit/
>```
>
>the canonical path to the `default` directory would be
>
>```
>/opt/smartgit/default/
>```

When a user starts SmartGit for the first time, the following files will be copied from the `default` directory (on the network share) to the user's personal SmartGit settings directory (refer to [Default Path of SmartGit's Settings Directory](Installation-and-Files.md#default-path-of-smartgits-settings-directory)):

- `smartgit.properties`
- `accelerators.yml`
- `credentials.yml`
- `hosting-providers.yml`
- `preferences.yml`
- `repository-grouping.yml`
- `tools.yml`
- `ui-config.yml`
- `ui-state.yml`

The `license` file (only for 10+ user *Commercial* licenses) can also be placed into the `default` directory. In the latter case, SmartGit will prefill the **License** field in the **Set Up** wizard when a user starts SmartGit for the first time. When upgrading SmartGit, this `license` file will also be used, so users won't be prompted with a 'license expired' message, but can continue working seamlessly.

#### Note

> Be sure to name the license file `license` in the `default` directory without any extension.
> There are a couple of [low-level properties](../GUI/AdvancedSettings/Low-Level-Properties.md#license-userseat-tracking) related to SmartGit's license management.

To preconfigure only a subset of default options to custom values and leave initialization of other defaults to SmartGit, you may provide reduced versions of the settings `.yml` files in the `default` directory.

Example

If you want to preconfigure the used Git executable to `C:\path\to\your\preferred\bin\git.exe`, you may use following `settings.yml` file:

```
git:
  executable: C:\path\to\your\preferred\bin\git.exe
```

### System properties vs. VM options

From a technical perspective, [low-level properties](../GUI/AdvancedSettings/Low-Level-Properties.md) and [VM options](../GUI/AdvancedSettings/VM-options.md) are the same thing, they are just specified in different files. System properties are specified in `smartgit.properties` in the [SmartGit's Settings Directory](Installation-and-Files.md#default-path-of-smartgits-settings-directory), VM options are specified in the `smartgit.vmoptions` file. From an administrative perspective, it's recommended to configure all system properties in the `smartgit.vmoptions` file and leave individual user `smartgit.properties` files untouched.

#### Note

> `smartgit.vmoptions` is loaded before `smartgit.properties` and thus properties present in `smartgit.vmoptions` have precedence over the same properties specified in `smartgit.properties`.
> This way, when having a read-only installation of SmartGit you can configure SmartGit in a pretty safe way using `smartgit.vmoptions`.

### Overriding With Defaults

By default, the files from the `default` directory will only be copied during the initial setup of the user's SmartGit installation. In certain scenarios, it may be desirable to replace a configuration even after SmartGit has been set up and used by a user. In this case, you can use the [VM option](../GUI/AdvancedSettings/VM-options.md) `smartgit.startup.settingsToReplaceFromDefault` to overwrite or patch the specified files in the user's settings directory. The file names listed for this VM option must contain the target files (like `preferences.yml` or `tools.yml`). For each of these files, SmartGit will check the `default` directory:

* for `.yml` files, if there exists a corresponding `.yml.patch` (for example `preferences.yml.patch`), the target file will be _patched_ with the contents of the default file
* otherwise, if there exists a corresponding file (for example `preferences.yml`), the target file will be _replaced_

#### Patching of YML files

Patching of `.yml` files works according to the following rules:

* new keys from the default-file will be added
* existing keys will be replaced by the value from the default-file
* keys prefixed by `-` in the default-file will be removed. You can combine `-` with new values to clear an entire section and then only re-add the specified defaults
* For lists, the default items will be added first and user items are only kept if they are not equal to a default item. List items that should be removed, need to have a key-value pair of `__merge__: delete`.

#### Example

> The **Tools** may be managed by the administrator and updated from time to time.
> Users should receive these updates regardless whether their SmartGit is already set up or not.
> To enfore a set of tools, prepare your `default/tools.yml` and add following line to `smartgit.vmoptions`:
> ```
> -Dsmartgit.startup.settingsToReplaceFromDefaults=tools.yml
> ```

#### Example

> To allow users to modify already pushed history and (re-)configure the Git executable path but otherwise keep their existing configuration intact, add following line to `smartgit.vmoptions`:
> ```
> -Dsmartgit.startup.settingsToReplaceFromDefaults=preferences.yml
> ```
>
> and prepare `default/preferences.yml.patch` with a content like:
>
> ```
> actions:
>   allowModificationOfPushedHistory: true
> -git:
>   executable: C:\Program Files\SmartGit\git\bin\git.exe
>   executable.absolute: C:\Program Files\SmartGit\git\bin\git.exe
> ```
>
> Note the `-` prefix for `git` which will ensure to clean up possible obsolete keys from older SmartGit versions and to result in a clean configuration like:
>
> ```
> git:
>   executable: C:\Program Files\SmartGit\git\bin\git.exe
>   executable.absolute: C:\Program Files\SmartGit\git\bin\git.exe
> ```

### Hide Preferences

When you are providing initial defaults or specify to overwrite defaults, you usually don't want the user to change these settings in the **Preferences**. 
Therefore, you might want to hide certain **Preferences** pages, using [low-level properties](../GUI/AdvancedSettings/Low-Level-Properties.md#smartgitpreferencescategoryvisible).
