# SmartGit documentation

If you are new to SmartGit, the [SmartGit User Interface Reference](Manual/GUI/index.md) is a good place to start.

This documentation is split into two sections, and each serves a distinct purpose:
- [Manual](Manual/index.md) 
  This section of the documentation offers an in-depth reference guide to SmartGit's features and functionality.
  It provides comprehensive descriptions of the software's tools, menus, options, and overall workflows.
- [How Tos](HowTos/index.md)
  This section focuses on specific, task-oriented guides that show how to perform particular actions within SmartGit.
  It is presented in a step-by-step format, making it clear and actionable.

In short, the [Manual](Manual/index.md) is a comprehensive feature reference, while the [How Tos](HowTos/index.md) section provides practical guides for particular tasks within SmartGit.
